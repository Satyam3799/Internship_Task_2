# 📊 Internship Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Titanic Dataset

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this task is to **understand the dataset using descriptive statistics and visualizations**.  
We aim to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, understand variable relationships, and prepare the dataset for effective modeling.

---

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- Data visualization techniques (histograms, scatter plots, boxplots, pairplots, heatmaps, etc.)
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std, skewness, kurtosis)
- Pattern recognition and feature interaction
- Multicollinearity and correlation analysis
- Insights extraction from raw data

---

## 📦 Dataset Info

- **Name**: Titanic-Dataset.csv
- **Rows**: 891
- **Columns**: 12
- **Target variable**: `Survived`
- **Features**: `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, `Embarked`, etc.

---

## 🔍 Process & Approach

### 1. Data Loading
- Loaded cleaned Titanic dataset using `pandas.read_csv()` / `read_excel()`

### 2. Summary Statistics
- Used `.describe()`, `.info()`, `.value_counts()` for initial understanding
- Checked nulls, datatypes, and unique value distributions

### 3. Univariate Analysis
- For **categorical features**: countplots, pie charts, donut charts
- For **numerical features**: histograms, KDE plots, boxplots, violin plots

### 4. Bivariate Analysis
- **Categorical vs Categorical**: cross-tabs, mosaic plots
- **Categorical vs Numerical**: barplots, swarm, violin
- **Numerical vs Numerical**: scatter plots, regression lines, joint plots, hexbin plots

### 5. Multivariate Analysis
- **Pairplots** with `Survived` as hue
- **3D Scatter plots** (Age vs Fare vs Parch)
- **Pivot tables** to extract insights across class, gender, survival

### 6. Correlation Analysis
- Created correlation matrix and heatmap
- Identified strong/weak correlations
- Investigated possible multicollinearity between features

---

## 📈 Tools & Libraries Used

- `Pandas` – data manipulation
- `Seaborn` – advanced plots
- `Matplotlib` – static graphs
- `Plotly` – interactive visualizations
- `Statsmodels` – mosaic plots
- `NumPy` – numerical stats

---

## ✅ Key Insights from EDA

- **Females** and **upper-class** passengers had higher survival rates
- **Fare** is positively correlated with survival
- **Family size** (via SibSp + Parch) had impact on survival
- Outliers were handled in `Fare` and `Age`
- `Cabin` column was dropped due to >75% missing values
- Class 3 passengers had the **lowest** survival rates

## 💬 Interview Q&A (Conceptual Understanding)

### 1. What is the purpose of EDA?
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) helps understand the structure, quality, and patterns in data using visual and statistical methods. It allows you to make informed decisions about preprocessing and modeling.

### 2. How do boxplots help in understanding a dataset?
Boxplots summarize the distribution of a numeric feature showing median, quartiles, and outliers. They help detect skewness, central tendency, and unusual values in the data.

### 3. What is correlation and why is it useful?
Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It helps identify redundant or influential features during feature selection.

### 4. How do you detect skewness in data?
You can detect skewness by:
- Checking `.skew()` values (numeric)
- Observing asymmetry in histograms or KDE plots
- Using boxplots to see uneven spread of whiskers

### 5. What is multicollinearity?
Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated. This can lead to unstable coefficients in regression models and reduce interpretability.

### 6. What tools do you use for EDA?
Common tools include:
- `Pandas` for data exploration
- `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib` for plotting
- `Plotly` for interactive visualization
- `NumPy` for descriptive stats
- `Statsmodels` for mosaic and statistical plots

### 7. Can you explain a time when EDA helped you find a problem?
Yes – during EDA on the Titanic dataset, we discovered that the `Cabin` column had over 77% missing values, making it unreliable for modeling. This insight led us to remove the feature entirely.

### 8. What is the role of visualization in ML?
Visualization plays a key role in:
- Identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies
- Feature selection and engineering
- Communicating results and insights to stakeholders
- Debugging models and understanding model behavior

## 📚 Final Note

EDA is a critical phase in any data science pipeline. A solid understanding of your data helps in building effective, robust, and interpretable machine learning models.
